## Overview

TurboGo is a gamified learning platform for the Base blockchain. It's designed for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, developers, and anyone looking to dive into the fast-paced world of Base. Our platform offers an engaging way to deepen your expertise while enjoying the thrill of virtual racing.

### What We're Solving

- **Fragmented Ecosystem Navigation**: Unifying the Base experience for streamlined learning, earning, and building.

### Our Approach
